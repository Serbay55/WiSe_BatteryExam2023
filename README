This App isn't finished properly due to illness and poor Time management between 2 Colleagues

We have struggled to bind our Room Database reactively with our Jetpack Compose GUI based on composable Functions.
The composable Functions needed MainViewModel and MainViewModelFactory classes including a Repository bound to the MainViewModel.
Despite our efforts to implement the above mentioned part, we have suffered a lack of knowledge based on how we man access
new Database data reactively and put it into list of ViewModel objects containing database connections. 

Furthermore we had the Goal to build statistics about Apps running in fore and background of our Android System.
The Background process of timing the Screen On Time works, but unforunately the Context within our application Context complex
is only capable of accessing package information running in the foreground that is the same package as the app itself.
Android and its safety protocol denied any touch to know which package was running in the foreground and therefore killed our plans
about tracking apps individually.

What does the App do?:

- It tracks the Screen On Time (Though we haven't visualized the number of minutes past due to first reason of failure)
- It tracks individual discharge and charge cycles
- It calculates the Health of the battery after 24 hours if its the first of Month
- The cycles are being multiplied with a temperature factor, because Li-ion Batteries suffer more in extreme temperatures
- The Screen On Time is being saved onto the current Date of use. -> For further statistics
- The User is being notified by a NotificationCompat.Builder when the Voltage levels of the Battery are too low on full charge or
  when the Battery level is below 20% or overheating.
  
The App is developed with a min sdk of 24 or Android 7 Nougat on a Pixel 3a.
